                    Running Fedwin's Fishing Companion
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                            ~Skill Check Page~
To run Fedwin's Fishing Companion, you first need to put in your proficiency modifier.
You and your GM should consider how that applies. I use either no modifier, full proficiency,
or double proficiency for mastery. You could also use the Survival Skill or a custom skill if
that more handily fits your needs. You will then choose how many times you will cast.
My general rule of thumb is that a single cast will take roughly 10 minutes. This isn't
exactly realistic, but feels like a good balance for my game. Feel free to rule on this
yourself. Either way, figure out how many casts you are going to make and put in that number
as well. Then hit the confirm button.

                                ~Region Page~
At this page, you have the option of 9 regions, each which have their own catchables lists.
Discuss with your GM which of these regions most closely matches your given region. Press
that button and it should automatically pick all of the fish that you have caught from that
region table and in the case you have critical failures or successes, it will select items
from separate lists that I made for those cases.

                                ~Roll Effects~
Now you may be wondering what benefit you derive from having better rolls in fishing. To keep
fishing simple and enjoyable, I have you catching something at every opportunity in version 1.0. 
The quality of your roll will impact how many fish are caught during a single casting period.
Technically based on my other rule, that means you are catching two fish at once, but hey,
lay off me.

                                Why I Made FFC
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thank you for choosing to use Fedwin's Fishing Companion! This application provides
automation for a fishing ruleset I originally wrote for use in my game. It was a useful
tool to me at the time, but it was time consuming and limiting to use it frequently.
This application automates that process and lets me have a wider variety of catchables
both for every region but adding more regions without creating what is essentially just
a fishing TTRPG instead of a small minigame for D&D.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I built Fedwin's Fishing Companion around D&D 5e pricing, which is to say I made
much of the pricing up on what I thought seemed in balance with other items in 5e.
You're welcome to use it for other games, but the price values added in version 2
may or may not be in balance with your particular game world.

Additionally, the skillchecks in this program are based around a d20 and a 5e
proficiency modifier, so your accuracy may vary based on these rules. Edits to
change this could be made easily enough if there are wishes for that to be the case.
